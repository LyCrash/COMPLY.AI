Focus on:
1. Data retention - Are retention periods clearly defined and justified?
2. Data deletion - Are procedures for secure data deletion described?
3. Data portability - Can users export their data in a machine-readable format?
4. Right to be forgotten - Is the right to erasure clearly explained?
5. Data minimization - Is there evidence of collecting only necessary data?

Identify lifecycle violations and provide recommendations for RGPD Articles 5, 15, 17, and 20 compliance.
